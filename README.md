## 🔲 What's Remaining

1. **Browser testing** — Verify responsiveness across desktop/tablet/mobile
2. **React migration** — Convert prototype to Vite + React after Node.js is installed

---

## 🚀 How to Preview

Just open `index.html` in any browser — no build tools or server needed.

```
# On Windows, double-click index.html or run:
start index.html
```

> **Note:** Images are loaded from Unsplash CDN, so an internet connection is required.

## 🔄 Future: React Migration Plan

Once Node.js is installed, the plan is to:
1. Scaffold with `npx create-vite@latest ./ --template react`
2. Convert each section into React components
3. Use React Router for multi-page navigation
4. Keep the same CSS design system (it's already modular)
